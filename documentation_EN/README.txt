Foreword

P.S.
	Hello, English-speaking community!
	This code was written in Russian, and to be honest, I don't think anyone will want to read it.
	But if you're here, you have one last chance to leave :)
		Because I don't have a sufficient level of language proficiency to write in English(( Of course, I translated the documentation using Google Translate, so I ask you
		not to be alarmed if you see any oddities in the translation. If something is unclear, the structure of the English text fully corresponds to the Russian version
		And if you think there are no problems, think again :) They are just beginning. All the code, comments, logs, and messages are in Russian, and the only solution is to throw the code into AI and ask it to translate.
	Hmm, why are you still here?
	Well, okay, then, I believe in your strength!
	

This is my first project of this size, so please don't judge the writing and logic too harshly :)
While writing the documentation, I gave up and handed this task over to claude. 
I wrote the code for 3-4 months. From the very beginning, it was conceived as a phone in the console, described via websocket, but it didn't quite work out. And we got an analogue of a program for remote access.
Required reading: server_technical_docs_EN.md, presentation_EN.txt
And if you still want to read more, this is what I wrote, and I think it's easier to understand, but I didn't quite finish it: Command_logic_EN.txt
And if you're interested in finishing the code, you can write a command input check, user names, or write readline functionality.
I would be very grateful if you add to my code or use it for any purpose. Please share, I'm very interested in how it works.

Contacts aren’t there for you to spam them with nonsense or remind me that I can’t code — I’m already well aware of that, no need to point it out. :)

Good luck with analyzing the code!
