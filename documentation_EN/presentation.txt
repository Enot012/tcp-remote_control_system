TCP Remote Control System
Asynchronous client-server system for remote control of computers via TCP.
Features:

    Remote control
    CMD - Execution of commands on clients
    SIMPL - Batch execution of commands from a file
    IMPORT/EXPORT - Two-way file transfer
	Deferred commands

Automatic command execution when a client connects
Target support: specific user, group, all clients
Execution status tracking
Placeholder {User} for substituting the client name

Group system:

    Creating user groups
	Bulk sending of commands to a group
    Participant management

Monitoring:

    Tracking active commands
    Timeouts and warnings
    Execution history
    Logging of all actions

Key features:

	Asynchronous architecture (asyncio) - simultaneous work with multiple clients
	All flag - mass sending of commands to all connected clients
	Auto-reconnect - the client automatically reconnects when the connection is lost
	Saving results - command execution history
	Renaming users (alias) for convenience
	Failure protection - error isolation, graceful degradation

server_v3_SIMPL_REALLY_FIXED.py
Control server. Accepts client connections, sends commands, receives results, manages deferred commands and groups.
Basic commands:
CMD <client|all> <command>        # Execute command
simpl <client|all>                # Commands from code.txt
import <client|all> <path> <path> # Send file
export <client> <path> [dir]      # Receive file
kick <client|all>                 # Disconnect client
rename <user> <alias>             # Rename
chart_new                         # Create delayed command
group_new <name>                  # Create group
list                              # User list
help                              # All commands
client_v3_SIMPL_ALL_FIXED.py
